# neilotoole/xcgo

`xcgo` is a maximalist Docker image for cross-compiling and releasing/distributing
CGo-enabled Go/Golang applications. At this time, it can build and dist macOS,
Windows and Linux CGo projects for arch `amd64`.

`xcgo` has what gophers crave:

- `go 1.14`
- `OSX SDK` Catalina / `macOS 10.15`
- `docker`
- `snapcraft`
- `goreleaser`
- `golangci-lint`
- `mage`
- `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh`
- and a bunch of other stuff.

The primary source of documentation for `xcgo` is the [wiki](https://github.com/neilotoole/xcgo/wiki).
Start there. There's a companion example project ([neilotoole/sqlitr](https://github.com/neilotoole/sqlitr))
that was created explicitly to exhibit `xcgo`: it demonstrates pretty much the entire
array of `xcgo`'s capabilities, showing how to release to `brew`, `scoop`, `snap`,
Docker Hub, GitHub, etc. The `neilotoole/xcgo` images are published to
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/neilotoole/xcgo).

## Usage

You can test `xcgo` with:

```shell script
$ docker run -it neilotoole/xcgo:latest go version
go version go1.14 linux/amd64
```

To play around in the container, launch into a shell:

```shell script
$ docker run -it neilotoole/xcgo:latest zsh
```

`xcgo` doesn't prescribe a particular usage approach. Some possibilities:

- Launch a container shell session, clone your repo, and build (or even edit and
  do all your work) within the container.
- Mount your local repo into the container, shell in, and build from within the container.
- With local repo mounted, invoke `xcgo` with `goreleaser`: this is pretty typical.

### Example: `go build` inside container

From inside the docker container, we'll build (`amd64`) binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Shell into the `xcgo` container if you haven't already done so:

```shell script
$ docker run -it neilotoole/xcgo:latest zsh
```

From inside the container:

```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/neilotoole/sqlitr.git && cd sqlitr
$ GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 CC=o64-clang CXX=o64-clang++ go build -o dist/darwin_amd64/sqlitr
$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/linux_amd64/sqlitr
$ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ go build -o dist/windows_amd64/sqlitr.exe
```
You should end up with something like this:

```shell script
$ tree ./dist
./dist
├── darwin_amd64
│   └── sqlitr
├── linux_amd64
│   └── sqlitr
└── windows_amd64
    └── sqlitr.exe
```

### Example: `goreleaser`

Quite possibly you'll want to use `xcgo` in conjunction
with [goreleaser](http://goreleaser.com).

Again, we'll use `sqlitr` to demonstrate. On your local machine, clone the `sqlitr`
repo, mount it into the `xcgo` container and run `goreleaser`:

```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/neilotoole/sqlitr.git && cd sqlitr
$ docker run --rm --privileged \
-v $(pwd):/go/src/github.com/neilotoole/sqlitr \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-w /go/src/github.com/neilotoole/sqlitr \
neilotoole/xcgo:latest goreleaser --snapshot --rm-dist
```

The above will build that CGo project via `goreleaser` with binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows:

```shell script
$ tree ./dist
./dist
├── build_linux_linux_amd64
│   └── sqlitr
├── build_macos_darwin_amd64
│   └── sqlitr

## Parameterization

Some params that can be passed to `xcgo` (as args to `docker run`):

- **Docker:** `-e DOCKER_USERNAME=X -e DOCKER_PASSWORD=X`

    When present, `xcgo`'s `entrypoint.sh` performs a `docker login`.
    Supply `-e DOCKER_REGISTRY=X` to use a registry other than Docker Hub.

- **GitHub:** `-e GITHUB_TOKEN=X` or `-e GORELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN=X`

    Used to publish artifacts to GitHub (e.g. by `goreleaser`).

- **Snapcraft:** `-v "${HOME}/.snapcraft.login":/.snapcraft.login`

    When `/.snapcraft.login` is present in the `xcgo` container, `entrypoint.sh`
    performs a `snapcraft` login. This enables use of `snapcraft`, e.g. by `goreleaser`
    to publish a `snap`.

    Supply `-e SNAPCRAFT_LOGIN_FILE=/other/place/.snapcraft.login` to specify an
    alternative mount location for the login file. See the [wiki](https://github.com/neilotoole/xcgo/wiki/Snapcraft)
    for more.
